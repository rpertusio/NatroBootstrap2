# NatroBootstrap2

*I am NOT accepting pull requests at this time. It's just for a sneak peek.*
=======
##### Once it is further along, I will fork the official Natro project and merge for more functional testing.


## INTRO

* My "big idea" for Natro is to rewrite the GUI using the Bootstrap framework with AutoHotKey.
* This repo is just a sandbox of my CONCEPT / pre-ALPHA thoughts on a GUI.
* I have unofficially named it **Natro Macro | Gummy Boot(strap) Edition** but it is NOT a real 'edition'. It's just a play on words (Get it?  GUI? Gooey? Gummy Boots? Bootstrap? nevermind...)
* This WON'T come anytime soon. And, it will probably fail.  And I'll probably give up a few times.

## WHAT IT IS
* It's a pet project of mine that I am doing in my spare time (weekend warrior).
* It's have posted it here for you to tinker/play/poke at my shoddy coding skills.
* It's a non-functional demo of the GUI front-end, not the back-end

## BUT
* It is NOT an official Natro Dev team project. It's just a hobby that (maybe) one day may make it
* It is NOT functional as a macro.  It's just a GUI (HTML + Javascript + CSS)

## 'Running' it:
* It's not a working Macro. Just a GUI. (Macro work may come later)
* [Download the zip](https://github.com/rpertusio/NatroBootstrap2/releases/), and run the .AHK file (adapted from [WebViewToo2](https://github.com/The-CoDingman/AHK/tree/main/v2/WebViewToo) )
* Requires Windows 10/11
* Or, you can simply open the ".html" file and it will open a browser to play with the controls
